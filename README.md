# AI Model Zoo Pro

Welcome to the AI Model Zoo Pro! This project serves as a professional, expert-level repository for various AI models, demonstrating their implementation, API integration, web application usage, examples, tests, and continuous integration.

## Features

- **Diverse Model Implementations:** Includes implementations of various AI models (PyTorch, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, RNN, CNN, K-Means).
- **RESTful API:** A Flask-based API (`api/app.py`) to serve model predictions.
- **Web Application:** A simple web interface (`webapp/index.html`, `webapp/app.py`) to interact with the models via the API.
- **Examples:** Demonstrative scripts (`examples/`) showing how to use the models.
- **Tests:** Unit tests (`tests/`) to ensure model functionality and API endpoints.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for automated testing.
- **Documentation:** Getting started guide (`docs/getting_started.md`).
